//Check if all numbers are divisible by 5. Cache the result in a variable.
//Check if the first number is larger than the last. Cache the result in a variable.
//Accomplish the following arithmetic chain:
//Subtract the first number from the second number.
//Multiply the result by the third number.
//Find the remainder of dividing the result by the fourth number.
//Change the way that isOver25 calculates so that we do not need to use the NOT operator (!) in other logic comparisons. Rename the variable as appropriate.
